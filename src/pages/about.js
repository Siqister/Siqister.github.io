				Hello, I'm an urban designer and technologist working at the intersection of <span>design</span>, technology, business strategy, and the built environment.
			</p>
			<p>As an urban designer, I have led the development of Boston Complete Street guidelines (winner of 2015 APA National Award in communication design); Go Boston 2030, the city's 20-year strategic mobility plan; a long-term design, implementation, and operational plan for the City of Grand Rapids parks department; as well as a strategic framework for the Mexico City campuses of ITESM, Mexico's largest private university system. I bring a clear design sensibility and an innovative approach to data analysis and storytelling to these diverse projects across different contexts and client types.</p>
			<p>My technology work broadly focuses on an interest in understanding and communicating urban complexity and galvanizing collective urban action. As a project lead at MIT Senseable City Lab, adjunct professor in information design at Northeastern University, and as a freelance developer, I continue to explore this interest through a variety of projects.</p>
			<p>A designer with strong programming abilities, I'm proficient with both frontend and backend technologies, and enjoy exploring the creative potential of new(-ish) technologies such as WebGL and deep learning.</p>
			<p>I work at Sasaki, where I manage urban planning and design projects and oversee a number of strategic marketing and business development initiatives, and at Northeastern University, where I teach graduate-level courses in information design and visualization. I continue to look for speculative project opportunities that intersect with my skills and intellectual interests.</p>
